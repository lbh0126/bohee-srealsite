<h2>3. 요즘 뭐해?</h2>
<p>My school will begin again on September... OH MY GOD.. In 2020, I took a break for the first
  time of my life. I applied for a leave of absence from school for the first semester. I did
  two or three part-time jobs for travel to Europe. But fucking Covid-19 made it impossible.
  It was so stressful but I could spend time at home with my family. And I could successfully
  get a driver's license and I passed computer test and Toeic. It was so meaningful.
